# WordleXTreme
Welcome to the WordleXTreme! It is a fun Bot Buddy created, updated, and maintained by Jack Tonn and Lottie Peterson as a fun side project to fascilitate their Wordle competition in their college-friends Discord server.

The current running version of the WordleXTreme is written in Java, however a Python version is in early stages of development to fascilitate easier debugging, fewer logical issues, and overall higher quality. Stay tuned for updates to come!

We hope you have fun with the WordleXTreme!
